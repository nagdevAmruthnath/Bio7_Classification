# Bio7_Classification

### A repository for a Bio7 Graphical User Interface for supervised classification which can be extended easily.

#### Download and compile the 'Main.java' class with Bio7 >=3.1 to open the interface.

Follow Button 1-4 for a classification workflow which trains and classifies images with R (scripts
are available in the R directory) in a non-blocking job.
 
Enable/disable/add filters in the 'createStackFeatures' method.

Until now Multichannel images (e.g. RGB) can be classified.

The 'ModelGui' graphical view interface can be extended with the Eclipse WindowBuilder plugin (SWT) if installed in Bio7.
